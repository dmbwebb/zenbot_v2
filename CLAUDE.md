# ZenBot Project Guide

## Project Overview
ZenBot is an AI-powered meditation guide web application that generates personalized guided meditations using OpenAI's GPT-4 and text-to-speech capabilities. It runs entirely in the browser for privacy.

## Key Technologies
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3
- **APIs**: OpenAI GPT-4 (text generation), OpenAI TTS (text-to-speech)
- **Audio**: Web Audio API for precise playback control
- **Offline**: Service Workers for offline capability
- **Deployment**: GitHub Pages static hosting

## Development Guidelines

### Testing
- Run tests using: `./test.sh`
- No package.json - this is a pure vanilla JS project
- Test in both desktop and mobile browsers

### Code Style
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- ES6+ features supported
- Modular structure with separate files for API, audio, and main logic

### Key Features to Maintain
1. Privacy-first: API keys never stored server-side
2. Browser-based: All processing happens client-side
3. Mobile-friendly: Must work on mobile browsers
4. Offline capability: Service worker implementation
5. Audio controls: Full playback control (play, pause, resume, stop)

## Important Files

### Main Application Logic
- `js/main.js`: Core application logic and UI interactions
- `js/api.js`: OpenAI API integration for GPT-4 and TTS
- `js/audio.js`: Audio playback management and controls

### User Interface
- `index.html`: Main application interface
- `css/styles.css`: Application styling

### Configuration
- `prompt_template.txt`: Template for generating meditation prompts

## API Integration
- Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 for generating meditation scripts
- Uses OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API for converting scripts to audio
- API key is provided by the user and stored only in session storage (optional)

## Deployment
The application is designed to be deployed as a static site on GitHub Pages at:
`https://[USERNAME].github.io/zenbot`

## Privacy & Security
- No server-side storage of API keys
- All API calls made directly from browser
- Optional session storage for convenience
- No user data collection or tracking

## Common Tasks

### Adding New Features
1. Maintain vanilla JS approach (no frameworks)
2. Keep privacy-first design
3. Ensure mobile compatibility
4. Test offline functionality

### Debugging
- Use `debug.html` for testing individual components
- Check browser console for API errors
- Verify Service Worker registration for offline mode

### Updating Prompts
- Modify `prompt_template.txt` to change meditation generation patterns
- Keep prompts focused on meditation and mindfulness

## Notes
- This is a static site with no backend
- All functionality runs in the browser
- Designed for simplicity and privacy
